# [Episode 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7iF6G3EyIk&list=PLlasXeu85E9cQ32gLCvAvr9vNaUccPVNP&index=7): undefined vs not defined in JS ðŸ¤”

__IMPORTANT POINTS__

* When JS is in memory allocation phase, it allocates each variable to a placehold. That placeholder is known as *undefined*.

* *undefined* is like allocating memory but not provided value yet.

* If a JS variable/object is not even found in memory allocation phase, it is never assigned as *undefined* also. So if tried to accessed, it shows *error: NOT DEFINED* as it is never allocated.

* *undefined* is not empty; it takes up memory. It stays undefined until it gets a value assigned to it.

* JavaScript is a *loosely-typed*/*weakly-typed* language.

* One can assign a number to it initially and can change whenever required to string, boolean etc.

* __NEVER__ assign *undefined* to any variable. Let it be used for its purpose only!
